# Discord-Spotify-Bot
A very simple discord bot that lets people upvote or downvote spotify songs and keeps track of the total votes.

> [!CAUTION]
>This code is not optimized nor is it complete, it is just a simple example of how to create a bot that can interact with discord and spotify.

- Songs are upvoted and downvoted by users and the top 10 songs are displayed in the discord chat when the --top command is used.

You are free to use this code as you wish, but please remember to replace the bot token and the spotify client id and secret with your own in the config.json file.

You will also need to install the discord and spotipy libraries using pip.

You can install them by running the following commands in your terminal:
```bat
pip install discord
```
```bat
pip install spotipy
```
